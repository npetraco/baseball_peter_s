This data is the list of at bats resulting in hits for the Houston Team at home in 2017

```{r }
hits <- read.csv("/home/npetraco/latex/papers/baseball_peter_s/HOU.home.season.hits2.csv")
hits
```

Now let use add some fields
I had to change pitches to a character field to count length
I added a field l.pitches for the lenth of the pitching field entry.
Using Tidyverse commands to try to learn them 

```{r mutate fields}
hitsm <- hits %>% mutate (pitches = as.character(pitches), l.pitches = nchar(pitches))
head(hitsm)
```
Now simple summary of counts

# Summary of counts of hits
```{r}

hitsm %>% group_by(hit.cod) %>% summarise(n=n())
```
Summary of average length of pitch sequnce by pitch type
```{r}
hitsm %>% group_by(hit.cod) %>% summarise(mean(l.pitches))

```
